# University-Volcano-App-Assignment
Assignment completed in my second year. Showcases the use of React and API's to build a dynamic website that provides information about volcanos.

## Getting Started
1. Make sure you have node.js installed on your system.
2. run "npm install" to download all dependencies.

## Notes
The API used with this project was privately created and run. Without this API the application does not currently gather any of the dynamic data.
